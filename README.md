# hpv_signature
The evhpv package supports the following analytical procedure:
  \t  1. Genbank information processing;
  \t  2. Fasta sequence processing: rename/extraction/deduplication/concatenation;
  \t  3. SNP finder for custom genetic classification, and reversely, identify genetic group based on marker SNPs
  \t  4. more to be added...
